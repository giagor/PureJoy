PureJoy is a third-party open source Android client developed based on the relevant interface of NetEase CloudMusic.

The purpose of developing this application is to practice the knowledge we have learned and to translate the theory into practice.



## API

As for the API, we deployed an open source project called "NeteaseCloudMusicApi" on our own server to get network data for our application. We recommend that you deploy the "NeteaseCloudMusicApi" project on your own server to ensure the stable running of your application.

For details, see [Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi](https://github.com/Binaryify/NeteaseCloudMusicApi).

You can replace the server address in the ServiceCreator.kt file of the projectï¼š

```kotlin
private const val BASE_URL = "..."
```
